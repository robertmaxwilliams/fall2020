# Code for the paper "Combinatorial Optimization for Road Networks"

- `ga.py`: has all the learning algorithms
- `graphs.py`: has the functions for adapting the learning algorithms to our problem
- `visualizer.py`: Special graphing function to visualize the learned solutions
- `cities.json`: Geo coords for major us cities, used as a real world problem to optimize
